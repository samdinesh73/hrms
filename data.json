        "description": "The post Ethereum’s Vitalik Fears Government Power Over Big Tech appeared on BitcoinEthereumNews.com.Ethereum developer Vitalik Buterin cautions that the greatest danger is held by governmental authority, not Big Tech. His essay, Balance of Power, discusses why decentralization is so essential nowadays. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, published a landmark treatise titled Balance of Power. The 240,000-word manifesto questions technological advancements. Buterin cautions that big government, big business, and big mob are all getting stronger together. Why Old Power Limits No Longer Work. The world was once closed by distance. Geographical barriers were completely destroyed by digital technology. There are no longer coordination issues that limit the size of companies. Everything has transformed when it comes to scale due to automation and AI. Buterin believes that the ancient beliefs of centuries are no longer relevant in 2025. The new technology threatens the old ways of protection against concentration. He calls the new reality a thick jungle whereby all mighty forces act on never-before-seen levels. The Math of Dangerous Growth of Power. The economies of scale generate geometric growth benefits. A company that doubles its resources performs better. This results in uncontrolled dominance mathematically. Two historical forces offset this trend. Natural limits were used to be given by diseconomies of scale due to inefficiency. Innovation is naturally disseminated through knowledge sharing amongst competitors. Quick automation means worldwide operation at low costs. Distribution is allowed by proprietary software without transparency. Organisations implement products on a global scale without exposing technology. This safeguards reverse engineering that was once disseminating innovation. Buterin recognises this as a mathematical inevitability that leads to concentration. Dangerous Government Merger in Silicon Valley. The essay is a fierce critique of the philanthropic change of billionaires. Buterin compares the libertarian technology culture in 2013. Modern direct political involvement is another thing. Executives in Silicon Valley desire state authority. According to him, this...",
